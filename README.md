# foobartory
Robots creating foo and bars.

## How to use:
:warning: You need python >= 3.7 to execute the program, because it uses `asyncio`.
```shell
# clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:tbcvl/foobartory.git
# execute the file
$ python3.8 foobartory/foobartory.py
```
:information_source: The output is very verbose (~3k logs) and the program takes ~20 seconds to run.
You may want to put the logs in a dedicated file:
```shell
$ python3.8 foobartory/foobartory.py > output.txt
```

## How to hack:
The "second" in the game is 1/100 second in real life.
If you want to change this, for example to able to read the logs in real time,
you can change the var `second_multiplier` in the code:
```diff
 class Factory:
-    second_multiplier = 1 / 100
+    second_multiplier = 1
     foo_list = []
```

## To Do / To enhance:
Give more control to the user with the command line options:
- parameter to control the `second_multiplier`, e.g. 1, 1/10, 1/100.
- parameter to control the output verbosity, e.g. none, everything (like today), or only robot and euros creation.
- parameter to display the time spent.
- parameter to control where is out the output, in file or console.
